Put main.c, hw3.c, Makefile, scheduler.o and scheduler.h in the same directory.
Use command "make" to compile main.c and hw3.c
They are complied as 
"gcc main.c -o main"
"gcc scheduler.o hw3.c -o hw3"

Execute hw3 by command like "./hw3 5 3 1 0". The last four arguments could be different number.
Execute main by "./main".
